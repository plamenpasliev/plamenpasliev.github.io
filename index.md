## Data Science Projects
### [Berlin Housing Listings](https://github.com/plamenpasliev/BerlinHousing)
- Scraped over 3000 listings from [immobilienscout24](https://www.immobilienscout24.de/).
- Used Google Maps API in combination with the [folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) library to make an interactive html page.

### [Hiding Unfair Bias in Neural Networks](https://github.com/plamenpasliev/HidingRacialBias)
- Predicted if US adults make more or less than 50k annually with over 80% acuracy
- Showed how an adversary can mask the feature importance of racial/gender features without affecting the prediction accuracy

### Neural Style Transfer for Furniture
- Beat hundreds of engineers and reached the final eight in an internal hackathon at Wayfair.
- Used Keras and TensorFlow to generate artificial pieces of furniture fitting to an arbitrary home style.

### Training Neural Networks with Manipulated explanations
- Master thesis work at TU Berlin.
- Trained a VGG16 neural net with the CIFAR-10 dataset and achieved top-1 accuracy of 92.46%.
- Extended current research and showed how popular explanation methods can be manipulated critically.
