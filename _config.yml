  Data Scientist

  Looking for new opportunities starting April 2020. Expected to graduate in February with two MSc degrees in Data Science, Innovation and Entrepreneurship, awarded by TU Berlin and Politecnico di Milano. I focused my academic coursework on Machine Learning and Neural Networks. I am particularly interested in unveiling bias in AI and explaining why complex algorithms make certain decisions.
