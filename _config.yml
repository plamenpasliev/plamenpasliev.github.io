  Looking for new opportunities starting April 2020. Expected to graduate in February with two MSc degrees in Data Science, Innovation and Entrepreneurship, awarded by TU Berlin and Politecnico di Milano. I focused my academic coursework on Machine Learning and Neural Networks. I am particularly interested in unveiling bias in AI and explaining why complex algorithms make certain decisions.

  Currently employed as a Data Science Working Student at Wayfair. I helped build end-to-end projects such as personalizing the Help & Contact page of their website. Over time, I took responsibility for maintaining and updating current models deployed in production. I developed a strong command of data science tools such as: Python, SQL, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, SK-learn, PyTorch, Keras and TensorFlow.
